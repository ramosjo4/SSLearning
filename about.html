Stepping Stone Learning is the product of the collaboration between Donatella Ramos, Kristi San Miguel, and Patrizia Arona three teachers who got tired of watching students struggle and dislike school and learning. We replaced everything that, through experience we know doesn't work in the classroom, and created our own early childhood program to help students build on their own individual skills and develop the academic skills they will need to succeed in school. Our program focuses on engaging hands-on activities and student-centered teaching strategies; we allow our students to play, explore, experience, and learn at their own pace; through trial and error students not only learn for a day, but remember the experiences and build upon them more advanced skills.

Our program statement is Play. Experience. Learn and it is more
than just a catch phrase or slogan; it is what we truly believe about lea
rning. Children are curious and creative by nature and we use that to help them
discover and develop academic skills. With us every
 child can succeed because every child can Play. Experience. Learn!</p>
