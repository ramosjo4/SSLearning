  <strong>Preschool 8:30 am to 11:30 am / Pre-k 8:30 am to 12:00 pm</strong>
    We are very proud of our high-quality, age appropriate curriculum. We believe providing a rich, stimulating environment helps our students explore their own way to knowledge. We offer 2 day, 3 day, and 5 day programs for preschool and pre-k classes.

Preschool & Pre-k / Add your name to the waiting list today!</strong>
We have fun extra curricular activities and projects planned for those students that stay with us all day. Our day ends at 5:30, pick-up time is from 5:30 to 6:00 pm.  At Stepping Stone Learning, learning never stops!

<p class="botp">
Our day is organized so that students can benefit from the structure of a preschool program and the motor and social activities of day care. In the morning all our students are divided into small, age appropriate classes and they participate in lessons and activities based on the academic standards of our curriculum. Our day includes morning activities like calendar, small and whole group activities, play-pretend time, and outdoor games; we learn about math, science, reading, writing, music and movement, art, and everything about how to interact with others. Our full day students enjoy a healthy lunch provided by Chef Jeremiah Lynch from the Cafe @ The Commons and daily different activities that include gross and fine motor skills, language skills, as well as, planned games and play time.
